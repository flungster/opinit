Pinboard is an attempt to create a simple "pinterest"-like web application using the
Play framework. There's no real attempt to handle scale here - if you're looking to 
create a pinterest like site with this to handle millions of users along with thousands of
pins, then you'll want to look elsewhere. 

The goal here was to create a simple MVC-based platform that allows users to:
* create accounts on the site
* create their own boards
* pin items to a board

Additionally, pinboard is a first of sorts for me. It's my:
* First open source project
* First project on github
* First project using the Play framework

You'll forgive me if you don't like things here or if you think I'm being simplistic. This
is more a learning exercise for me than an attempt to build something usable for others.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me here on github.

Configuration Notes:
The current version of this application uses postgres for a persistent store. If you plan
on using a different database then you'll want to edit the conf/application.yml file to point
to the respective database or in-memory model.

How to run:
1. Make sure you have the play framework installed
2. Go to the directory you cloned the project into and type "play run"
3. The web app will run on http://localhost:9000

How to run the tests:
1. Make sure you have the play framework installed
2. Go to the directory you cloned the project into and type "play test"
3. You can execute tests by going to http://localhost:9000/@tests

Improvements:
1. Consider going to service model (service tier acting as intermediate layer between data and front-end)
2. Replace postgres with mongodb given how many users/boards/pins one could have
